10.100 - Grid CSS
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    repeat - creates a set number of columns
    auto-fill = css system will decide how many columns
    minmax = each column is 250 px wide,
      1fr = max allocation of space - in this context for each column that we create, make them all the same size

10.101 - issues with grid CSS

10.102 - creating an image card Component
  de-structure -- we were referring to this.props.image multiple times, therefore to clean up... this below

    alt={this.props.image.description}
    src = {this.props.image.urls.regular}

    we added/altered this:
      const {description, urls} = this.props.image;
      alt={description}
      src = {urls.regular}

10.103 accessing the DOM with refs
  let the ImageCard render itself and its image
  reach into the DOM and figure out the height of the image
  set the image height on state to get the component to rerender
  when rerendering, assign a 'gird-row-end' to make sure the image teakes up the appropriate space

  When we need to reference item we do not use JS functions, instead in REACT, we use REF
    REACT REFS
      Gives access to a single DOM element
      we create refs in the constructor, assign them to instance variables, then pass to a particular JSX elements as props

10.104 - Accessing Image Height
  this.imageRef=React.createRef();
    by using this, we can figure out information about this DOM node

    REFRESH - componentDidMount - is only called after render
      componentDidMount() {
        console.log(this.imageRef);
      }
        Then in the console, we are able to see the clientHeight

10.105 - callbacks on image load
  this.imageRef.current.addEventListener('load')
    this indicates that the item is fully loaded and element is accessible

10.106 - Dynamics Spans
  "es2015 template string"
    `spans ${this.state.spans}`

10.107 - app review
  With PROPS system, we ONLY communicate from a parent to a child
  Need a key on the list we are rendering
  createRef = can reach into the DOM
