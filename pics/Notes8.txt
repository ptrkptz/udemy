8.88 - fetching data
	unsplashed.com

8.89 - Axios vs Fetch

	React does NOT make the request to API
		it is only show HTML or handling interactions
	AJAX Client
		this sends request to API

	AXIOS
		3rd party pkg (use npm)
	FETCH
		built into browsers
		more basic (lower level)
			alot more code to write (vs axios)

	Install in project
		npm install --save axios

	the import list - usually the 3rd party are above the file that WE create

8.90 - viewing request results
	get the api url
		unsplash.com > developers > documentation > schema > location

8.91 - Handling requests with async await
	Component renders itself one time with no list of images
	onSearchSubmit method called
	request made to unsplash
		wait
	request complete
	set image data on state of app component
	app component rerenders and show images

	.then
		this is a 'promise'
		to view the data as coming back
			axios
			    .get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos',{
			      params: { query: term },
			      headers: {
			        Authorization: 'Client-ID 49af3f824a55d34d764582ecf747a033bef20c1414f35860a5bea6826df3c8d3'
			      }
			    })
			    .then((response) => {
			      console.log(response.data.results)
			    });

	async
		use async syntax within the function
			easier to use/understand

8.92 - Setting state after async request
	added this (in App.js):
			<SearchBar onSubmit={this.onSearchSubmit} />
			Found:  {this.state.images.length} images

	caused error ' is not a function' (as talked about eariler)
		added a console.log to this:
			console.log(this);
			this.setState({ images: response.data.results})
		added <SearchBar onSubmit={this.onSearchSubmit} guessWhatIam="blah"/>
			in the console log (chrome), I can see the 'guessWhatIam'
			therefore 'this' is not what we expect it to be

8.93 - Binding callbacks
	From this:
	async onSearchSubmit(term) {

	To this:
	onSearchSubmit = async term => {

8.94 - Creating custom clients
