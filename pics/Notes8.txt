8.89 - Axios vs Fetch
	
	React does NOT make the request to API
		it is only show HTML or handling interactions
	AJAX Client
		this sends request to API

	AXIOS
		3rd party pkg (use npm)
	FETCH
		built into browsers
		more basic (lower level)
			alot more code to write (vs axios)

	Install in project
		npm install --save axios

	the import list - usually the 3rd party are above the file that WE create
