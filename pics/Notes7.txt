7.76 - add project structure

7.77 showing forms to user

7.78 - adding a touch of style
	
7.79 - creating event handlers
	onChange={this.onInputChange}
		note there is no () as is a not a function
			if you add the (), everytime the render is call the onInputChange is called
			by NOT having the (), the onChange is called only on the event
	onChange
	onClick
	onSubmit

7.80 - alternate event handler syntax
	onChange={this.onInputChange} & associated function all to  (event) => console.log(event.target.value)
		'arrow function'

7.81 - controlled and uncontrolled elements
	uncontrolled  (text input)


7.82 - more on controlled elements
	Start Flow here
		User types in input
		Callback gets invoked
		We call setState with the new values
		Components rerenders
		Input is told what its value is (coming from state)
			the Text box 'value' field is populated via 'this.state.term'
	End flow

	If the data/value is stored in STATE we can quickly and easily retrieve the data/value
