4.44 class-based components
	functional components 
		simple content

	class components
		everything else
		Benefits
			easier code organization
			can use 'state' (another React system)
				easier to handle user input
			understand lifecycle events
				easier to do things when the app starts up

4.45 Application Overview
	users physical location
		from the browser
	current month
	change text and styling based on location + month

4.46
	framework build

4.47 getting users physical location

4.48 resetting location preferences
		the i on the browser, this kicks down a site information (next to the url)
			select 'Block'
			results in Console = message: "User denied Geolocation"

4.49 handling async operations with functional components
	Time start
		js file loaded by browser
		app component is created
		call geo location service
			this takes a bit of time
		app returns jsx, page starts to render
		.
		.
		.
		we get geolocation -- after waiting a bit

4.50 refactor functional component to class component
		(added to above)
		Tell the component to rerender itself with new info

	Rules of Class Components
		must be a JS class
		must extent (subclass) React.Component
		Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX
